# Movie Recommendation API
An open movie recommendation API that has been built using Python based on yhis [tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-movie-recommendation-api-using-scikit-learn-flask-and-heroku-bee239dc96e3).
This API is based on the Content-Based Filtering technique used in recommendation systems where we recommend items to a user based on the input item's attributes. 
We have more than 6000 movies present in our dataset and our recommendation algorithm works accordingly.
